# Myzbase

A simple and attractive page for bands to use when Myspace dies

## Purpose ##

Myspace is dying. Nobody likes it. But for lots of people in the music industry it's the only way they know how to look up bands. Myzbase is functionally similar to Myspace (without all the crap), and is intended as a replacement for a band's Myspace page.

It is not supposed to be a complete band website, so it is intentionally basic. Think of it more as a landing page for your website, a way of capturing the people who still insist on typing `blah blah myspace` into Google.

## Status ##

It's a work in progress. A first draft. It's been built quickly on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com). Once it's ready for production I'll update this to say so.

## How to use it ##

I don't know yet. I have two ideas, which may both work. One is to host the template on GitHub and let web-savvy band members host their own version, which they can customise as much as they want (very much like the awesome [The Personal Page](https://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page)). The other is to host the pages on my server, and bands can email me their details (photo, web link, Soundcloud ID, Songkick ID, contacts).
